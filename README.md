# rust-tinyasm

A Rust port of my Python submission for http://redd.it/1kqxz9:

> Tiny, a very simple fictional computer architecture, is programmed by an assembly language that has 16 mnemonics, with 37 unique op-codes. The system is based on Harvard architecture, and is very straight-forward: program memory is different from working memory, the machine only executes one instruction at a time, memory is an array of bytes from index 0 to index 255 (inclusive), and doesn't have any relative addressing modes.
>
Your goal will be to write an assembler for Tiny: though you don't need to simulate the code or machine components, you must take given assembly-language source code and produce a list of hex op-codes. You are essentially writing code that converts the lowest human-readable language to machine-readable language!
